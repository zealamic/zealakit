# NestJS

**Clarity and explicit boundaries beat clever NestJS magic.** Prefer feature modules, constructor injection, and thin controllers.

Aligns with [typescript](../typescript/SKILL.md) and [javascript](../javascript/SKILL.md). For `src/` layout and layer rules, follow [structure-ddd](../structure-ddd/SKILL.md).

## Critical rules

1. **Feature Nest modules** — one `bootstrap/modules/<feature>.module.ts` per bounded context. Source files stay **layer-first** per [structure-ddd](../structure-ddd/SKILL.md).
2. **No circular module imports** — extract shared modules or use domain events.
3. **Constructor injection only** — no service locator (`ModuleRef.get` in business code).
4. **Interfaces via injection tokens** — bind domain ports in infrastructure.
5. **Single-responsibility services** — split orchestration (application) from domain rules.
6. **Controllers are adapters** — map HTTP ↔ application use cases; no business logic.
7. **Validate at the edge** — DTOs + pipes for input; throw Nest HTTP exceptions at presentation or map domain errors there.
8. **Repository ports in domain/application** — implementations live in infrastructure.
9. **Test with `TestingModule`** — mock ports, not Nest internals; e2e with Supertest.
10. **Config via `ConfigModule`** — no scattered `process.env` in domain code.

## Application

When **writing** NestJS code:

- Put Nest decorators in presentation / infrastructure adapters, not in pure domain entities.
- Export only what other modules need; keep providers private by default.
- Follow [structure-ddd](../structure-ddd/SKILL.md) for where files live.

When **reviewing**:

- Flag circular modules, business logic in controllers, `any` providers, and infrastructure leaking into domain.
